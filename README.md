# Typescript
This repository contains a JavaScript project that demonstrates the conversion of JavaScript code with basic types without using TypeScript. The project includes multiple branches and follows a feature-based workflow.

**1.Create a GitHub Repository:**

Create a new repository on GitHub with two branches: **main** and **develop.**
Create a simple **README.md** file that briefly describes the purpose of the repository in English.

**2.Create a New Feature Branch:**

From the **develop** branch, create a new branch called **feature/js-to-ts.**

**3.Add JavaScript Code:**

In the **feature/js-to-ts** branch, create a file named **index.js.**
Add 200 lines of JavaScript code to this file.

**4.Add Type Annotations to JavaScript:**

Rewrite the JavaScript code in **index.js,** adding type annotations (for example: number, boolean, string).
Note: Do this without installing TypeScript and without changing the file extension (keep the file as **index.js**).

**5.Commit Changes and Merge:**

After completing the changes, commit your work.
Push the **feature/js-to-ts** branch to GitHub.
Open a pull request (PR) to merge the **feature/js-to-ts** branch into the **develop** branch.
Once the pull request is reviewed, merge it into **develop.**

**6.Share the Repository:**

Provide a link to the repository after completing all the tasks.
