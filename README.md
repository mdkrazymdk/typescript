**Task: GitHub Integration and Interactive Website with TypeScript**
The goal of this task is to create an interactive website using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, while managing your project using Git and GitHub. By the end of the task, you'll have a live website hosted on GitHub Pages, demonstrating interactive features like event handling and data fetching. Below are the detailed steps.

**1.Create a new branch feature/tsconfig**

Start by creating a new branch named feature/tsconfig in your existing GitHub repository. This branch will be used for the implementation of the HTML/CSS template and the integration of TypeScript.

**2.Find and add an HTML/CSS template**

Search for a ready-made HTML/CSS template (you can find free templates online or use a simple one). Add this template to the feature/tsconfig branch.

**3.Install TypeScript**

After adding the template, set up TypeScript in the feature/tsconfig branch. Use the appropriate command to install TypeScript (npm install typescript or similar, as covered in the lecture).

**4.Add interactivity with JavaScript in the template**

Make the website interactive by adding JavaScript features such as:

Modal windows (e.g., pop-ups that open and close).

Event listeners like scroll or click for user interaction.

Animations that enhance user experience.

Fetching data using fetch() from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and displaying it dynamically on the webpage.


**5.Write JavaScript in TypeScript**
Write all JavaScript code in a TypeScript (.ts) file. Ensure that you define primitive types (number, boolean, string, etc.) in your code. Compile the TypeScript file into JavaScript.

**6.Connect the compiled JavaScript to HTML**
Once your .ts file is compiled into JavaScript, link the compiled .js file in your HTML template to ensure the website functions correctly.

**7.Push the changes to the feature/tsconfig branch**
After setting up TypeScript, configuring the tsconfig file, and adding interactivity, commit and push all the changes to the feature/tsconfig branch.

**8.Create a GitHub Pages site from the feature/tsconfig branch**
After pushing your changes, set up GitHub Pages to host your website directly from the feature/tsconfig branch. Follow the instructions at GitHub Pages to get your site live.

**9.Submit the GitHub repository link and live site URL**
After completing the above steps, submit:
The link to the feature/tsconfig branch.
The link to your live website hosted on GitHub Pages.

**10.Describe the interactive features in comments**
In your task submission comments, describe all the interactive features you've added to the website (e.g., how modal windows work, what events are triggered, how data from the API is displayed, etc.).
